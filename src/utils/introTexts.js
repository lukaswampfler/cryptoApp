export const permutationIntroText = `
The key for the permutation method is any reordering of the letters a-z \n
Transposition: changes the position of two random letters in the secret alphabet\n
Shuffle: random ordering of the whole secret alphabet \n
Identity: reset the secret alphabet equal to the clear text alphabet, i.e. Output equals Input.\n
You can see the whole key by sliding left - right.`

export const rsaIntroText = `
A key for the RSA-method consists of two parts: a private key and a public key, each having an exponent and a (common) modulus.\n
Input: Any number which is smaller than the modulus n. \n
GENERATE/USE OWN KEYS: In this screen you can generate a new key pair or import YOUR OWN KEYS \n
IMPORT KEYS: import public keys of other users of the App.

ENCODE MESSSAGE: change to the screen where you can write your message and it will be (ASCII-)coded and directly used as input for SDES. Alternatively, you can use any sequence of bits of length 8, 16, 24, ... as input.\n
The key for S-DES is a bit-String of length 10.\n
CALCULATE K1, K2: the two keys (each length 8) will be calculated.\n
RSA ENCRYPT 10-BIT KEY: in a real scenario, the key of the symmetric method would be encrypted using an asymmetric method (i.e. RSA)
